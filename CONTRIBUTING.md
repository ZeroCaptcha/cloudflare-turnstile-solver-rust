# Contributing to cloudflare-turnstile-solver-rust

Thank you for helping. This repository is a small, working example that ZeroCaptcha maintains. Fixes, clearer code and better tests are welcome.

## Run the tests

You need Rust 1.75 or later (stable).

```sh
cargo test
```

The tests run against a stand-in API on your machine: they need no API key, make no real task and spend nothing. CI runs the same commands on every push and pull request.

## Pull requests

- One change per pull request, with a test when behaviour changes.
- Keep the code small, readable and dependency-light, in the style around it.
- Never commit an API key, a proxy password or an `.env` file. The tests use made-up keys.
- By contributing, you agree that your contribution is licensed under the MIT licence of this repository.

Open an issue with one of the templates for a bug in this repository or an idea for it. For your account, a task, a payment or anything about the service itself, write to support from the [contact page](https://zerocaptcha.io/contact) and quote the request ID from the error.
